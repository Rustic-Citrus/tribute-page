                <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
                <p>Albert Edward MacColl was born in Dumbarton in 1882, and later known as Sir Edward MacColl. He was educated at Dumbarton Academy, the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and Glasgow University. His practical experience in electrical engineering began at the Clydebank shipyard of John Brown and Co., Ltd., where he served for five years​.</p>
                <h4>Career</h4>
                <p>MacColl's early career began in 1902 with Glasgow Corporation's Tramways Department, where he worked on electrifying the previously horse-drawn system. By 1918, he had joined the Clyde Valley Electric Power Company as their Chief Technical Engineer, working on coal-fired power stations. His shift towards hydro-electric power began with a project at the Falls of Clyde, Scotland's first hydro-electric scheme designed for public supply. The success of this project marked a pivotal moment in MacColl's career, showcasing his expertise in hydro-electric power engineering.</p>
                <p>In 1927, MacColl moved to the Central Electricity Board, working on long-distance transmission lines and inventing the MacColl Protective System, a significant advancement for controlling transmission lines globally. By 1933, he had created Scotland's National Grid, marking the first regional distribution grid in Britain, which served as a prototype for the rest of the National Grid in the country.</p>
                <h4>Contributions to Hydro-Electric Power</h4>
                <p>MacColl's tenure as the Vice Chairman and chief executive officer for the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board marked a period of significant achievements. His understanding of the local landscape, coupled with his engineering genius, helped pioneer hydro power in Scotland, bringing electricity to the Highland glens.​</p>
                <h4>Legacy</h4>
                <p>Sir Edward MacColl was knighted in 1949 for his exceptional contributions to engineering and hydro-electric power development. He passed away on 15 July 1951, just a day before his wife Lady Margaret MacColl was to perform the formal opening of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme. Through his lifelong efforts, MacColl left an indelible mark on Scotland's electrical infrastructure and the broader field of electrical engineering.</p>
